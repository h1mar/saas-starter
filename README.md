# SaaS Starter
Simple, unstyled SaaS starter with a modern stack for your next project.

## Stack
- Typescript
- Next.js
- Prisma
- Stripe
- NextAuth.js

## Features
- Subscriptions and payments handled by Stripe with webhooks (Billing Portal, Checkout)
- Auth with NextAuth, this starter uses magic links, [but they have multiple providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/overview)
- Easily interact with your database using Prisma (I recommend using [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) or [Supabase](https://supabase.io/))
